# I.3.7 – The Ontology as Design Grammar

**Constraint**\
The ontology functions as a symbolic grammar that defines what is real, possible, and permissible within the system. It must explicitly encode the rules, relationships, and constraints necessary to ensure that any design, operation, or propagation maintains life-aligned coherence.

**Realization**\
The system gains a shared, generative language that allows diverse actors and components to create in alignment without constant external enforcement. This grammar becomes the living blueprint for coherent structure, function, and evolution.

**Failure Modes**

* **Semantic Drift:** Without a clear grammar, key concepts lose meaning and the system fragments.
* **Incoherent Design:** Elements are created without reference to shared constraints, causing misalignment.
* **Uncontrolled Propagation:** Without a coherent grammar, replication spreads incompatible or harmful structures.
* **Dependency on External Control:** Lacking a self-governing design grammar forces reliance on top-down enforcement.

**Cross-Commitment Coherence**

* **Reality is a Self-Configuring, Self-Referential System:** The grammar defines the self-referential rules that allow self-configuration.
* **Telic Core: Purpose is Intrinsic, Not Assigned:** The grammar encodes the telos in a symbolic form that persists through change.
* **Form Precedes Function:** The grammar governs the creation of forms that enable regenerative function.
* **Systems are Recursive and Fractal:** The grammar applies equally at all scales, ensuring design coherence is fractally maintained.

**Audit Criteria**

* **Symbolic:** The ontology is documented as a formal grammar, with explicit syntax, semantics, and constraints.
* **Empirical:** Systems built from the grammar show measurable coherence and life-alignment across implementations.

**Propagation Check**\
A coherent design grammar ensures that every instantiation of the system, regardless of scale or context, inherits the same life-aligned logic. Without it, propagation inevitably results in divergence and degradation.

**Field Relation Mapping**

* **Primary Field:** Field 7 – Seed (propagates design logic intact).
* **Supporting Fields:** Field 3 – Pattern (ensures grammar preserves invariant relationships); Field 4 – Structure (ensures grammar is structurally embodied).
* **Secondary Interdependencies:**
  * **Field 2 – Tensegrity:** The grammar must encode balance between stability and adaptability.
  * **Field 5 – Bridge:** Grammar propagation depends on relational transfer between systems.
  * **Field 6 – Rhythm:** Grammar updates must occur in cyclical review and renewal phases.
