# I.3.1 – Reality is a Self-Configuring, Self-Referential System

**Constraint**\
A system must generate its own structure, meaning, and coherence from within. All phenomena within the system emerge from internal relations and self-referential processes, without dependency on an external architect to define its purpose or order. This self-configuring property ensures the system’s integrity is not contingent on external imposition.

**Realization**\
The system becomes an autonomous, generative whole — capable of defining and maintaining its internal logic, adapting through self-generated feedback, and preserving coherence as it evolves.

**Failure Modes**

* **Dependency Fragility:** Reliance on external control or definition creates vulnerability to capture, manipulation, or collapse if the external source fails.
* **Identity Drift:** Without internal self-referentiality, the system’s identity fragments as it absorbs incoherent external inputs.
* **Loss of Generativity:** A system that cannot self-configure defaults to replication of external patterns, forfeiting its adaptive creativity.

**Cross-Commitment Coherence**

* **Telic Core: Purpose is Intrinsic, Not Assigned:** Self-configuration is the operational expression of intrinsic purpose.
* **Form Precedes Function:** Self-generated form defines and constrains all possible functions.
* **Systems are Recursive and Fractal:** Self-referentiality provides the mechanism for pattern propagation without translation loss.
* **Coherence is Alignment with Life’s Logic:** Self-configuration ensures that coherence is endogenous, not externally imposed or fragile.

**Audit Criteria**

* **Symbolic:** The system’s structural map contains internally defined generative rules and feedback loops.
* **Empirical:** The system can demonstrably alter its internal state and functions without introducing externally authored logic, while maintaining operational integrity.

**Propagation Check**\
When propagated, the system carries its own generative grammar. Self-configuring logic ensures that any replication remains adaptive and internally coherent, even in new contexts.

**Field Relation Mapping**

* **Primary Field:** Field 1 – Essence (provides the core telic anchor and self-generating purpose).
* **Supporting Fields:** Field 3 – Pattern (ensures propagation of self-referential rules across scales); Field 4 – Structure (maintains relational integrity of self-generated form).
* **Secondary Interdependencies:**
  * **Field 2 – Tensegrity:** Self-configuration depends on holding generative tensions between stability and adaptation.
  * **Field 5 – Bridge:** Self-reference is enriched through semi-permeable interfaces that bring in contextual feedback.
  * **Field 6 – Rhythm:** The self-configuring process requires temporal pacing to integrate changes without destabilization.
