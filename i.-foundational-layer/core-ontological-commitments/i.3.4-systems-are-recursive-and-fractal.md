# I.3.4 – Systems are Recursive and Fractal

**Constraint**\
A system must replicate its coherence across all scales of organization. Structural and functional logic must be fractal, meaning that each part reflects the coherence of the whole, and recursive, meaning that the same design logic governs both micro and macro scales without translation loss.

**Realization**\
The system expresses the same generative logic in every instance, scale, and recursion cycle. Local actions inherently reinforce systemic coherence, and systemic structures naturally support the viability of local operations.

**Failure Modes**

* **Scale Drift:** Coherence is lost when moving between operational scales, causing fragmentation or misalignment.
* **Local Optimization:** Parts optimize for themselves at the expense of whole-system integrity.
* **Loss of Fidelity:** Design logic degrades as it propagates, leading to incoherent structures at higher or lower scales.

**Cross-Commitment Coherence**

* **Reality is a Self-Configuring, Self-Referential System:** Recursion allows the system to self-configure in a consistent manner across all levels.
* **Telic Core: Purpose is Intrinsic, Not Assigned:** Purpose remains intact across scales through recursive logic.
* **Form Precedes Function:** Form is replicated with fidelity before functions emerge at each scale.
* **Coherence is Alignment with Life’s Logic:** The same life-aligned patterns govern every scale of system organization.

**Audit Criteria**

* **Symbolic:** The system’s design explicitly documents self-similarity across scales, with no structural or functional contradictions.
* **Empirical:** Observations at different scales confirm the presence of the same operational logic and relational patterns.

**Propagation Check**\
Replication requires maintaining the same generative pattern at all levels. A break in recursion at any scale undermines whole-system coherence.

**Field Relation Mapping**

* **Primary Field:** Field 7 – Seed (ensures propagation with structural and functional fidelity).
* **Supporting Fields:** Field 3 – Pattern (preserves invariance); Field 4 – Structure (maintains form integrity across scales).
* **Secondary Interdependencies:**
  * **Field 2 – Tensegrity:** Recursion fidelity depends on tension-holding structures that maintain pattern integrity across scales.
  * **Field 5 – Bridge:** Fractal patterns require boundary-spanning to ensure coherence between nested layers.
  * **Field 6 – Rhythm:** Recursion must include temporal cycles so patterns propagate over time, not just space.
