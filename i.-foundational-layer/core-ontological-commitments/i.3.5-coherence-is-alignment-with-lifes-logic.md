# I.3.5 – Coherence is Alignment with Life’s Logic

**Constraint**\
A system is coherent only when its structural layers, functional dynamics, and evolutionary trajectories align with the generative patterns of living systems. Coherence cannot be claimed if it is achieved at the expense of life’s capacity to self-generate, self-regulate, and sustain diversity over time.

**Realization**\
The system sustains its own integrity while enhancing the integrity of the larger living contexts in which it operates. Its operations contribute to the health, resilience, and adaptive capacity of those contexts, ensuring mutual viability.

**Failure Modes**

* **Extractive Optimization:** Achieving internal stability by degrading surrounding living systems.
* **Closed-Loop Narcissism:** Maintaining internal order while ignoring systemic harm caused externally.
* **Pattern Distortion:** Adopting structures or rhythms that break alignment with life’s core generative logic.

**Cross-Commitment Coherence**

* **Reality is a Self-Configuring, Self-Referential System:** Ensures self-coherence is also ecologically embedded.
* **Telic Core: Purpose is Intrinsic, Not Assigned:** Anchors purpose in life-serving outcomes, not abstract goals.
* **Form Precedes Function:** Prevents functional execution if structural form is misaligned with life patterns.
* **Systems are Recursive and Fractal:** Guarantees life alignment is preserved across all scales of operation.

**Audit Criteria**

* **Symbolic:** The system’s design map explicitly references life’s generative patterns as non-negotiable design constraints.
* **Empirical:** System performance metrics show positive contributions to the health and diversity of living systems over time.

**Propagation Check**\
Propagation is only valid when coherence is life-aligned; otherwise, the system replicates structural harm.

**Field Relation Mapping**

* **Primary Field:** Field 1 – Essence (anchors telos in life-serving coherence).
* **Supporting Fields:** Field 3 – Pattern (ensures alignment with life’s generative structures); Field 6 – Rhythm (synchronizes with life’s temporal dynamics).
* **Secondary Interdependencies:**
  * **Field 2 – Tensegrity:** Coherence depends on managing paradoxes and polarities without collapse.
  * **Field 5 – Bridge:** Life alignment requires continuous exchange with the living environment.
  * **Field 6 – Rhythm:** Alignment is sustained through life’s cyclical renewal patterns.
