# I.3.6 – Temporal Operational Integrity

**Constraint**\
A system must operate in regenerative cycles of action, integration, and renewal. Sustained coherence is a rhythmic condition, not a static state; without cyclical renewal, operational integrity erodes over time.

**Realization**\
The system maintains its capacity and purpose across time by pacing its activities, integrating learning, and renewing resources. Rhythmic operation prevents burnout, fragmentation, and decline, enabling long-term viability.

**Failure Modes**

* **Systemic Burnout:** Continuous operation without renewal phases depletes capacity and resilience.
* **Structural Rigidity:** Lack of integration cycles blocks adaptation and learning.
* **Boom–Bust Dynamics:** Erratic pacing causes instability, leading to collapse.
* **Repetitive Failure:** Without integration phases, mistakes recur and compound.

**Cross-Commitment Coherence**

* **Reality is a Self-Configuring, Self-Referential System:** Cycles provide the feedback windows necessary for self-configuration.
* **Telic Core: Purpose is Intrinsic, Not Assigned:** Purpose is enacted sustainably through recurring renewal, not one-off execution.
* **Coherence is Alignment with Life’s Logic:** Embeds the temporal rhythms of living systems as a structural requirement.
* **Form Precedes Function:** Form includes temporal architecture that sustains functional capacity.
* **Systems are Recursive and Fractal:** Cycles recur across all scales, ensuring temporal coherence is fractal.

**Audit Criteria**

* **Symbolic:** The system’s design documents define explicit operational cycles and renewal phases.
* **Empirical:** Time-series data on system activity show measurable, repeating patterns of action, integration, and renewal.

**Propagation Check**\
Only systems with built-in regenerative cycles can propagate coherence reliably over time; without this, replication spreads instability.

**Field Relation Mapping**

* **Primary Field:** Field 6 – Rhythm (encodes temporal integrity).
* **Supporting Fields:** Field 1 – Essence (aligns cycles with telos); Field 3 – Pattern (ensures cycles are consistent and fractal).
* **Secondary Interdependencies:**
  * **Field 2 – Tensegrity:** Temporal pacing depends on balancing cycles of expansion and contraction.
  * **Field 5 – Bridge:** Renewal phases require external sensing and relational integration.
  * **Field 7 – Seed:** Rhythmic integrity must be embedded in what is propagated forward.
