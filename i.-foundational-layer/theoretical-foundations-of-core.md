# Theoretical Foundations of CORE

<mark style="color:orange;">**\<THIS SECTION IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION>**</mark>

CORE is structured around foundational invariants. These are are symbolic operators that define the conditions for coherence to emerge, scale, and remain viable. Each principle is embedded in the recursive logic of the 7-Field Ontology. Every Field expresses a propagation function dependent on the structural truth of these foundations.

#### **I.7.1 — Ontological Primacy and Consciousness as Substrate**

_Confirmation: Analytic Idealism (Kastrup), CTMU (Langan), Implicate Order (Bohm)_

Reality originates from a symbolic substrate held within consciousness. Essence forms the generative base through which all Fields differentiate.

* Telos and recursion function as structural constants.
* Consciousness provides the carrier field for symbolic continuity.
* Systems generate form and identity through symbolic differentiation.

#### **I.7.2 — Recursive Syntax and Structural Closure**

_Confirmation: CTMU (Langan), Symbolic Recursion (Berenholtz)_

Symbolic recursion underlies all propagation. Coherence is maintained through structural closure of syntax and meaning.

* Feedback encodes identity across cycles.
* Semantic integrity is preserved through reflexive symbolic structures.
* Disintegration occurs when recursive syntax loses structural resolution.

#### **I.7.3 — Holonic Architecture and Nested Coherence**

_Confirmation: Holonic Logic (Koestler, Mella)_

Propagation requires scalable coherence. Holons function as nested symbolic operators, each maintaining internal autonomy and external relational fit.

* Structure and Seed operate as recursive holonic functions.
* Polarity embeds mutual interdependence into each layer.
* Multiscale coherence depends on symbolic nesting, not linear accumulation.

#### **I.7.4 — Feedback Epistemology and Pattern Emergence**

_Confirmation: Levin (Morphogenetic Intelligence), Pourdehnad (Recursive Learning)_

Pattern and Rhythm emerge through structural feedback, not repetition or variation. Feedback coherence ensures symbolic structures remain adaptive and alive.

* Symbolic memory operates through distributed sensing and retention.
* Learning structures emerge from identity-aligned feedback loops.
* Regenerative systems adjust form through reflexive symbolic calibration.

#### **I.7.5 — Constraint Design and Planetary Boundaries**

_Confirmation: Meadows (Leverage Points), Raworth (Doughnut Logic), Capra (Ecological Systems)_

Constraint is a structural requirement for systemic integrity. Rhythm and Field interactions define the temporal and ecological boundaries for viable propagation.

* Leverage points encode phase thresholds within system architecture.
* Social foundations and ecological ceilings define biophysical viability conditions.
* Collapse results from loss of structural rhythm under constraint breach.

#### **I.7.6 — Symbolic Infrastructure and Telic Propagation**

_Confirmation: CORE Meta-Architecture_

All Fields function as symbolic structures. Regenerative propagation depends on structural fidelity of meaning, role, pattern, and constraint across time and scale.

* Meaning is encoded in structure, not in reference.
* Propagation occurs through telically aligned symbolic scaffolds.
* Coherence is preserved only when every symbolic operator retains recursion integrity.
