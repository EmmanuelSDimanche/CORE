# Field 7 – Seed

**1. Field Function**\
Seed holds the logic of propagation. It carries the system’s capacity to replicate coherence across scales, contexts, and cycles. This Field does not introduce new purpose. It transmits the telic pattern embedded in Essence and confirms that all system expressions retain structural alignment and regenerative capacity. Seed does not appear as a structure. It functions as a recursion signal. No other Field encodes the threshold for systemic readiness.

**2. Why This Field Exists**\
Without Seed, the system cannot propagate without loss. Replication becomes duplication. Structures repeat without vitality. Purpose fragments or flattens. Seed ensures that every instance of growth re-expresses coherence. It tests whether the system can sustain life while expanding. This Field prevents drift through symbolic recursion.

**3. When This Field Breaks**\
When Seed fails, propagation becomes extraction. Elements scale without coherence. Outcomes replicate form without function. Feedback loops stop cycling. Systems reproduce, but nothing regenerates. Trust erodes. Alignment disappears across layers. Renewal becomes impossible. The system moves, but cannot become.

**4. Symbolic Role**\
Seed shows up as recursion that holds integrity. In people, it appears as generative transmission of purpose across life stages. In projects, as designs that remain coherent through scale and adaptation. In platforms, as protocols that generate new coherence rather than just enforce compliance. In bioregions, as cycles of cultural, ecological, and economic regeneration that do not require external input. Seed makes coherence replicable.

**5. Systemic Interactions**\
Seed receives its propagation logic from Essence, carrying forward only what aligns with telic intent. It tests the tensions held by Polarity to ensure that propagation does not collapse into polarity failure. It reflects the patterns established in Pattern, verifying that these can scale without loss of structure. It confirms that Structure can hold new instantiations without rigidity or fragmentation. It reads feedback from Bridge to verify that adaptation has produced stability. It synchronizes with Rhythm to ensure propagation flows with systemic tempo rather than disruption.
