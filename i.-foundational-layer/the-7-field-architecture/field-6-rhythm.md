# Field 6 – Rhythm

**1. Field Function**\
Rhythm holds the tempo of coherence. It governs the movement of trust, attention, capacity and resource through the system. Rhythm regulates circulation. It aligns internal timing with external conditions. This Field anchors the system’s metabolic integrity. It sustains motion across cycles without disintegration.

**2. Why This Field Exists**\
Rhythm allows a system to remain coherent while in motion. It synchronizes flow with place, attention with capacity, and response with signal. Without Rhythm, the system overextends, fragments, or lags. It loses coherence not through failure, but through misalignment with time.

**3. When This Field Breaks**\
When Rhythm distorts, flows become erratic. Surplus cannot return. Trust decays. Feedback arrives out of phase. Coordination falters. Attention scatters. The system moves either too quickly to metabolize or too slowly to respond. Its coherence dissolves across intervals.

**4. Symbolic Role**\
Rhythm carries the system’s pulse. In people, it shapes cycles of work and rest. In projects, it sets cadence for delivery and pause. In platforms, it organizes interaction across temporal spans. In bioregions, it speaks through season, migration, and yield. Rhythm gives the system its capacity to remain present across time.

**5. Systemic Interactions**\
Rhythm receives orientation from Essence, aligning systemic movement to the system’s core purpose. It adjusts its pacing to reflect the tensions held in Polarity, ensuring no pole dominates flow or tempo. Rhythm modulates the expression of Pattern by conditioning its interval, density, and recurrence. It regulates timing across Structure, ensuring that roles and processes activate in coherence with broader systemic cycles. Rhythm metabolizes feedback from Bridge, translating signal into timing adjustments rather than reactive disruption. It governs the internal pulse that prepares the system for propagation, holding coherence long enough for Seed of Life to activate without collapse.
