# CORE Epistemic Commitments

<mark style="color:$info;">**This ontology is grounded in a specific epistemic logic: that systems are known only through relationship, that coherence must be engaged to be perceived, and that knowledge is structurally constrained by alignment.

{% endhint %}

CORE rests on the following epistemic commitments. They define how coherence is encountered, how structure is revealed, and how understanding can propagate without collapse.

**1. Knowing is Relational**

Knowledge does not stand outside of systems. It arises through interaction, tension, and feedback. The knower is embedded in the known. Each perception alters structure. Each signal shifts coherence.

In regenerative systems, knowledge cannot be imposed or extracted. It must emerge through participation. This is not a stance. It is a structural fact of living systems.

**2. Understanding is Iterative**

Coherence is not fixed. It appears through cycles of rhythm, feedback, and symbolic return. Understanding is not captured in statements or diagrams. It aligns through enactment.

Truth in living systems is recursive. It arrives through interaction, not declaration. To understand a system is to remain within its rhythm long enough for coherence to stabilize.

**3. The Ontology Is a Symbolic Grammar**

This ontology is not a framework or belief system. It functions as a symbolic grammar. It holds the constraints through which living systems can perceive, metabolize, and adapt.

Its function is not to describe, but to sustain coherence. Its use is not instructional. It is infrastructural. Every Field, every logic, every form within CORE is designed to make systems legible to themselves.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:$success;">**CORE makes systemic self-awareness possible.**</mark>\ <mark style="color:$success;">This is the ontological threshold that differentiates CORE from interpretive models. It enables living systems to perceive and align themselves without external intervention.</mark>
{% endhint %}

**4. Telic Sovereignty Is Structurally Required**

Meaning arises through relation. Alignment cannot be imposed. For coherence to hold, each system must retain the capacity to choose how it engages, adapts, and learns.

This condition is telic sovereignty: the structural right of all systems to align from within. Without this, propagation becomes distortion. Without this, feedback becomes force. CORE protects telic sovereignty not as value, but as design condition.

**5. Epistemology Follows Ontology**

CORE does not treat knowledge as independent of form. Epistemology is recursive. It arises from ontological structure. The way a system is known must match the way it exists.

Ontology defines what is. Structure expresses how what is holds. Epistemology reveals how what is can be aligned with. All three layers form a single grammar. Coherence depends on their integration.
