# WHY Do Our Economies Lack Coherence?

> “It's better to do the right thing wrong than the wrong thing right, because the more we do the wrong thing right, the wronger we become.”\
> — Russell Ackoff

**Human designed systems fail not from a lack of technology but from a lack of coherence. CORE provides the structure to regenerate coherence at every scale.**

The dominant economies of today are not designed to cohere.\
They scale without sense, move without rhythm, grow without grounding.

Markets track price, but not value.\
Financial systems manage scarcity, but cannot hold surplus.\
Institutions measure performance, but collapse without shared purpose.\
\
This is not a tooling problem.\
It is a breakdown in the structure of meaning.\
An ontological failure\
\
There is no grammar for regenerative alignment.
