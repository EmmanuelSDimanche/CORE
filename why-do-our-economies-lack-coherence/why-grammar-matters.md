# Why Grammar Matters

Systems cannot function without coherence.\
Institutions cannot govern without shared language.\
Change cannot propagate without legibility.

Grammar is not about language.\
It is the invisible architecture of meaning.\
It determines what can be seen, said, and done before anything happens.

What grammar cannot express, a culture, a whole cannot perceive.\
What it cannot hold, a system cannot steward.\
What it does not encode, a world cannot propagate.

The current economic grammar encodes fragmentation.\
It collapses trust into compliance, reduces value to price, and renders life as input.\
It cannot express care, hold surplus, or propagate coherence.

CORE restores grammar as a regenerative force.\
It is a symbolic substrate that allows life to re-enter the structure of our economies and networked organizations along territories.
