**System**

Definition: A system is a whole that cannot be divided into independent parts without the loss of its essential properties or functions.\


#### Purposeful System

Definition:\
\[...] Thus a purposeful system is one that can change its goals in constant environmental conditions; it selects goals as well as the means by which to pursue them.  It thus displays will.

#### End

Definition:\
An immediate intended outcome of a subject A in a particular choice environment S in a relatively short time period t₁–t₂; an outcome that

* 1\) is a member of an exclusive and exhaustive set of available outcomes for A, and
* 2\) has maximum relative value to A in S and t₁–t₂.

Thus, an end is an outcome that a subject intends most strongly in a particular environment at a particular time and that is obtainable therein.

#### Goal (an intermediate intended outcome)

Definition:\
Of a subject A over a set of choice environments and time-period t₁–t₂:\
The last outcome Oₖ of a set of available outcomes {O₁, O₂, ..., Oₖ}, which are ordered so that V₁ < V₂ < ... < Vₖ for A over t₁–t₂.\
If any outcome Oⱼ (j < k) of the set is obtained, the probability of obtaining Oⱼ₊₁ in t₁–t₂ is increased.

#### Objective (a long-range intended outcome)

Definition:\
Of a subject A over a set of choice environments and time-period t₁–tₘ:\
The last outcome Oₘ of a set of outcomes {O₁, O₂, ..., Oₘ}

* 1\) that are ordered so that V₁ < V₂ < ... < Vₘ for A over t₁–tₘ; and
* 2\) Oₘ is not an available outcome for A in that set during t₁–tₘ but is attainable at a later time n (n > m).

Thus, an objective is a desired outcome that is not obtainable in the time period being considered, but progress toward it is still possible during that time-period.

#### Ideal (an ultimate intended outcome)

Definition:\
Of a subject A over a set of exclusive and exhaustive environments {S} and a (relatively long) time-period t₁–tₙ:\
The last outcome Oₙ of a set of outcomes {O₁, O₂, ..., Oₙ}

* 1\) ordered so that V₁ < V₂ < ... < Vₙ for A over t₁–tₙ; and
* 2\) Oₙ is not a possible outcome for A in any possible environment in {S} over t₁–tₙ, but every not-yet-obtained outcome in the set that is possible for A at a time tⱼ (1 ≤ j < n) is either an end, goal, or objective that A has not yet obtained.

An ideal, therefore, is an outcome that can never be obtained but can be approached without limit.
