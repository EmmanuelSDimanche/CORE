# COHERE Glossary

#### Agency

Narrative Definition: The capacity to sense, interpret, and act in ways that maintain and advance viability.\
Technical Definition: A property of a system that enables it to perceive changes in its environment, process these perceptions in context, and act upon them with the aim of preserving or enhancing its operational integrity.

#### Alignment Grammar

Narrative Definition: A structured set of design and decision-making principles that ensure all system components remain coherent with one another and with life-aligned logic.\
Technical Definition: The operationalized syntax and semantics governing the relationships between ontological elements, such that their interdependencies maintain systemic coherence under all operational contexts.

#### Base-12 Ontological Maturity Model

Narrative Definition: A developmental framework that tracks a system’s evolution through 13 sequential Horizons, each representing a milestone of structural and functional maturity.\
Technical Definition: A staged maturity architecture where Oindex ∈ {1…13}, each representing a verified milestone in the system’s capacity to sustain coherence. Includes Structuring Horizons (O7, O8, O13) as governance inflection points.

#### Bridge Horizon (O5)

Narrative Definition: The milestone where a system first establishes formal, coherent interfaces with external systems.\
Technical Definition: The point in the Base-12 Ontological Maturity Model at which governance expands from internal scope to interface oversight, ensuring relational integrity across inter-system boundaries. Activation of minimal interface governance protocols is required.

#### Care Horizon (O8)

Narrative Definition: The milestone where the system demonstrates sustained internal stability and capacity to nurture its relational network.\
Technical Definition: A Structuring Horizon marking the verified readiness of a system to maintain regenerative flow over time, triggering the shift from reactive governance to stewardship governance for relational and metabolic health.

#### Generativity

Narrative Definition: The ability to create conditions for new forms of life, complexity, and coherence to emerge.\
Technical Definition: The capacity of a system to produce novel, life-aligned configurations that increase systemic complexity without compromising existing coherence.

#### Governance (in COHERE)

Narrative Definition: The structures and processes that maintain coherence across all layers of the ontology.\
Technical Definition: Layer-bound mechanisms of decision-making, constraint enforcement, and adaptive review, activated in proportion to the system’s maturity (per Structuring Horizons).

#### Ideal (canonical, Ackoff)

Narrative Definition: An outcome that can never be fully achieved but can be continually approached without limit.\
Technical Definition (Ackoff): Of a subject A over a set of exclusive and exhaustive environments {S} and a time period t₁–tₙ: the last outcome Oₙ of a set {O₁, …, Oₙ} ordered so that V₁ < V₂ < … < Vₙ for A over t₁–tₙ, where Oₙ is not a possible outcome in any possible environment in {S} over t₁–tₙ, but every attainable outcome at tⱼ (1 ≤ j < n) is either an end, goal, or objective not yet obtained.

#### Life

Narrative Definition: A self-organizing, self-maintaining, and self-adapting system that sustains its integrity by aligning with its environment.\
Technical Definition: Life is a system that exhibits agency across scales, self-organizes, self-maintains, and self-adapts by maintaining its essence, structure, and field dynamics in alignment with environmental conditions, enabling regeneration and adaptive evolution over time.

#### Life-Aligned

Narrative Definition: A state or action that sustains and strengthens the capacity of life to regenerate.\
Technical Definition: Conformance of system design, process, or decision to principles that preserve systemic viability, adaptability, and regenerative potential.

#### Purposeful System (canonical, Ackoff)

Narrative Definition: A system that can set and change its own goals.\
Technical Definition: A system that can change its goals in constant environmental conditions, selecting both the goals and the means to achieve them, thus displaying will.

#### Regenerative Coordination

Narrative Definition: A form of coordination that actively restores and strengthens the systemic conditions necessary for life.\
Technical Definition: A coordination mode that produces outcomes enhancing systemic resilience, adaptability, and regenerative potential, rather than depleting them.

#### Structuring Horizons

Narrative Definition: Key milestones in the maturity model that mark a fundamental shift in the system’s capabilities and governance needs.\
Technical Definition: In the Base-12 Ontological Maturity Model, O7, O8, and O13; the inflection points where system function changes category, governance is redefined, and new systemic capacities are formally activated.

#### System (canonical, Ackoff)

Narrative Definition: A whole whose parts cannot be separated without loss of essential properties.\
Technical Definition: (1) A whole that cannot be divided into independent parts without the loss of its essential properties or functions. (2) A set of interrelated elements, each directly or indirectly related to every other, and no subset unrelated to another subset. Hence, a system is an entity composed of at least two elements and a relation that holds between each of its elements and at least one other element in the set. The elements form a completely connected set that is not decomposable into unrelated subsets. Therefore, although a system may itself be part of a larger system it cannot be decomposed into independent subsystems.

#### Tensegrity (canonical, Buckminster Fuller)

Narrative Definition: A structural principle where components maintain stability through continuous tension and discontinuous compression.\
Technical Definition: Tensegrity is the structural-relationship principle in which shape is assured by a finitely closed, comprehensively continuous tensional system, rather than by discontinuous, local compression members.\
