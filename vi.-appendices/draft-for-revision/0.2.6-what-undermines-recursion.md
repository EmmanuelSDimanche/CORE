# 0.2.6 â€“ What Undermines Recursion

Systems repeat without renewal when their architecture is incomplete. They scale through iteration, but cannot re-enter themselves with integrity. Roles are added. Programs expand. Coordination grows. The form extends, but coherence does not.

This breakdown does not begin with visible failure. It begins with success that outruns structure. Each new layer inherits unresolved gaps from the one before. Misalignments deepen as they propagate. Complexity masks the loss of continuity until the system can no longer recognize itself across scales.

Recursion is the capacity of a system to return to its origin condition without collapse. It requires that every architectural layer remain coherent as the system grows. When even one operation is missing or misaligned, the pattern fragments under its own extension. Identity blurs. Purpose loses traction. Trust cannot transfer.

Without structural completeness, the system iterates. It continues to perform, but cannot renew. Decisions require re-anchoring. Relationships require re-interpretation. Design requires re-explanation. These are not signs of responsiveness. They are symptoms of recursive breakdown.

Recursion cannot be simulated. It must be embedded. It depends on synchronization across the architecture: every layer aligned, every signal carried, every threshold met. Where that alignment holds, the system regenerates. Where it breaks, it repeats.

COHERE provides the structural grammar that makes recursion possible. It does not initiate coherence. It ensures coherence can return.
