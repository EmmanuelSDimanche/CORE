# 0.2.7 â€“ The Structural Causes of Propagation Collapse

Systemic collapse rarely begins with external threat or resource scarcity. It begins when the architecture that once held coherence cannot support further scale. The structure fragments under its own extension. Alignment breaks. Recursion halts. What once felt integrated begins to scatter.

Expansion without synchronization turns growth into drift. New roles are added without anchoring. Decisions replicate without memory. Feedback loops distort rather than inform. The result is not chaos. It is fragmentation that still functions. Activity continues, but coherence dissolves.

This breakdown is structural. It happens when trust cannot transfer, purpose cannot scale, and feedback cannot synchronize. The original identity is no longer legible across the system. What the system is, what it does, and what it is becoming start to diverge.

Propagation requires more than duplication. It requires symbolic infrastructure that preserves form while allowing for difference. When identity, role, signal, and rhythm are not aligned across layers, the system cannot hold itself through change. This failure is not visible at first. It accumulates until no part of the system can reference the whole.

COHERE exists to prevent this pattern. It provides the structural grammar required to scale without losing coherence. Where architecture completes, systems can recurse. Where it fractures, even the best intentions fragment.
