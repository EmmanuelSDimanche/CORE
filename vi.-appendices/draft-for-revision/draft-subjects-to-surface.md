Unpacking “governance from the inside”(I.5 CORE Epistemic Commitments)

**Option A: II.4 — Application Layer: Structural Integrity of Governance**\
Here it can be treated as a _field-applied constraint_. Explains why CORE-informed governance must emerge from within the system’s own coherence architecture.

**Option B: IV.3 — Propagation Layer: Recursive Sovereignty and Telic Legitimacy**\
Here it would be unpacked as a _system propagation constraint_. Explains why externally imposed governance cannot scale regenerative systems.

**Where to unpack “bridge between regenerative design and symbolic recursion”?**

**Placement:**\
Section **I.7 — Theoretical Foundations of CORE**

**Reason:**\
This is a meta-architectural claim. It names the _epistemic inflection point_ where regenerative design ceases to be about sustainability techniques and becomes about symbolic alignment.

Treat this in **I.7.3 — Symbolic Recursion as Design Infrastructure** (recommended new sub-section). It can follow theoretical subsections on systems theory, morphogenesis, and epistemology.
