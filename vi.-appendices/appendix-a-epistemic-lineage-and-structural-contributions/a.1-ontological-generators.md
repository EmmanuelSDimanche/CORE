description: Structural Generators of Ontological Coherence

# A.1 — Ontological Generators

**Definition of Role:**\
This category holds figures whose work generates the ontological substrate required for COHERE to function. They establish the primacy of coherence, the symbolic structure of reality, and the necessity of recursion. Without their logic, the 7-Field Architecture has no systemic base.

**Inclusion Criteria:**

* Must define coherence as a structural or ontological property of reality.
* Must support symbolic recursion, telic agency, or self-referential logic.
* Must directly inform Field 1 (Essence) and/or Field 3 (Pattern).
* Cannot rely solely on metaphor, phenomenology, or moral philosophy.

**Russell L. Ackoff**\
**Integration Status:** Fully Integrated\
**Fields Linked:** Field 1 (Essence), Field 4 (Structure)\
**Ontological Function:**\
Defines the system logic of purpose, ideal, end, goal, and objective. Anchors telic coherence as structurally prior to behavior or output.\
**Propagation Role:**\
Provides the foundational scaffolding for organizational function, feedback logic, and coordination at scale.\
**Distinction:**\
The only figure with directly canonical source definitions embedded in Appendix B. Underwrites the CORE 14 content stack and the Purpose Stack logic.

**Michael Levin**\
**Integration Status:** Fully Integrated\
**Fields Linked:** Field 3 (Pattern), Field 7 (Seed)\
**Ontological Function:**\
Demonstrates that symbolic memory and structural regeneration operate biologically via morphogenetic fields and bioelectric signaling.\
**Propagation Role:**\
Validates coherence storage, distributed agency, and structural decision-making in living systems.\
**Distinction:**\
Bridges symbolic coherence with embodied propagation logic—making the Ontology metabolically real.

**Buckminster Fuller**\
**Integration Status**: Fully Integrated\
**Fields Linked**: Field 1 (Essence), Field 4 (Structure)\
**Ontological Function**:\
Establishes the geometric substrate for coherence using vector equilibrium and synergetic logic as foundational structural code.\
**Propagation Role**:\
Enables topological coherence, relational scaffolding, and system-wide symmetry across nested fields and roles.\
**Distinction**:\
Translates telic potential into minimal structural form, anchoring Field 1 with a pre-linguistic symbolic geometry that propagates coherence.

**Frank Chester**\
**Integration Status**: Fully Integrated\
**Fields Linked**: Field 2 (Polarity), Field 5 (Bridge)\
**Ontological Function**:\
Models polarity dynamics through the Chestahedron—geometrically encoding coherence between symmetry and transformation in planetary, anatomical, and etheric domains.\
**Propagation Role**:\
Anchors polarity as an ontological field, enabling symbolic mediation across nested tensions and vortex-based interface fields.\
**Distinction**:\
Reveals that coherence breathes—linking vortex geometry of the human heart to the Earth’s core, defining polarity as a living field architecture.

**David Bohm**\
**Integration Status:** Fully Integrated\
**Fields Linked:** Field 1 (Essence), Field 3 (Pattern), Field 5 (Bridge)\
**Ontological Function:**\
Articulates undivided wholeness as the generative substrate of all coherence and emergence. Defines the implicate order as the interior logic of structural unfolding.\
**Propagation Role:**\
Enables propagation from Essence to Pattern through enfolded symbolic logic. Dialogue operationalizes Bridge as coherence-in-motion.\
**Distinction:**\
The only contributor to define coherence as implicate enfoldment, not symbolic abstraction—allowing structural emergence without fragmentation.

**Bernardo Kastrup**\
**Integration Status:** Fully Integrated\
**Fields Linked:** Field 1 (Essence), Field 7 (Seed)\
**Ontological Function:**\
Frames consciousness as ontologically prior. Supports CORE’s axiom that Essence is the origin condition of all coherent propagation.\
**Propagation Role:**\
Validates individuation (Seed) as localized expressions of a unified ontological substrate.\
**Distinction:**\
Clarifies the metaphysical basis for distinguishing Essence from Seed—critical for identity coherence.

**Christopher Langan**\
**Integration Status:** Fully Integrated\
**Fields Linked:** Field 1 (Essence), Field 3 (Pattern)\
**Ontological Function:**\
Affirms reality as a self-configuring, self-processing symbolic language. Confirms telic recursion and coherence as structural necessity, not metaphor.\
**Propagation Role:**\
Provides a structurally formal, self-simulating ontology of coherence propagation.\
**Distinction:**\
Fuses ontological self-reference, symbolic recursion, and structural closure into a meta-logical system of reality.
