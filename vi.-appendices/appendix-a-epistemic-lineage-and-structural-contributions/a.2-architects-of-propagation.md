# A.2 —Architects of Propagation

**Definition of Role:**\
This category includes those who design systemic architectures that allow coherence to propagate across scales, roles, or domains. These figures provide the blueprint for holonic integration, nested recursion, and structural resilience—enabling the Ontology to hold coherence beyond the origin point.

**Inclusion Criteria:**

* Must design or formalize systems that scale holonically or recursively.
* Must demonstrate how coherence is propagated, not just described.
* Must directly inform Field 2 (Polarity), Field 4 (Structure), and/or Field 7 (Seed).
* Must operate at the scale of propagation logic—not just operations or domains.

### Contributors

#### **Arthur Koestler & Piero Mella**

* **Integration Status:** Fully Integrated
* **Fields Linked:** Field 2 (Polarity), Field 4 (Structure), Field 7 (Seed)
* **Ontological Function:**\
  Define holons as simultaneously wholes and parts, forming the conceptual grammar for recursive system design and nested scale.
* **Propagation Role:**\
  Enable propagation through holarchic logic, where each unit functions autonomously and integratively within broader systems.
* **Distinction:**\
  Establish the primary logic of holonic coherence essential for multiscale propagation and interdependent autonomy.

#### **Jamshid Gharajedaghi**

* **Integration Status:** Fully Integrated
* **Fields Linked:** Field 2 (Polarity), Field 4 (Structure)
* **Ontological Function:**\
  Extends systemic logic into interdependence, layering, and dynamic role-function alignment. Translates purpose into adaptive structure.
* **Propagation Role:**\
  Supports propagation across enterprise and institutional forms through recursive, role-based design.
* **Distinction:**\
  Bridges Ackoff’s purpose logic into real-time systemic adaptation—allowing role and structure to evolve without losing coherence.

#### **Tom Graves**

* **Integration Status:** Fully Integrated
* **Fields Linked:** Field 1 (Essence), Field 4 (Structure), Field 5 (Bridge)
* **Ontological Function:**\
  Defines coherence across meaning, value, and behavior. Establishes content structures for Vision and Enterprise as functional elements of propagation.
* **Propagation Role:**\
  Enables diagnostic coherence and functional propagation across organizational layers and epistemic interfaces.
* **Distinction:**\
  Directly responsible for the canonical content architecture of “Enterprise” and “Vision” as used in CORE. Critical to coherence transmission across domains.
