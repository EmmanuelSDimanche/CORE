# A.4 — Constraint Codifiers

**Definition of Role:**\
This category frames the outer boundary conditions within which CORE must function. These thinkers codify the ecological, economic, and sociopolitical limits that all regenerative systems must metabolize. They ensure that symbolic coherence translates into viability.

**Inclusion Criteria:**

* Must diagnose systemic misalignment or collapse conditions.
* Must define outer constraint fields (planetary boundaries, social thresholds, governance structures).
* Must directly inform Field 6 (Rhythm) and/or Field 2 (Polarity).
* Must offer translational or boundary-setting logic, not only value systems or critique.

#### **Donella Meadows**

* **Integration Status:** Fully Integrated
* **Fields Linked:** Field 6 (Rhythm), Field 2 (Polarity)
* **Ontological Function:**\
  Defines leverage points and collapse dynamics within complex systems. Clarifies constraint emergence through systemic feedback failure.
* **Propagation Role:**\
  Translates system fragility into timing, delay, and limit structures—enabling Field 6 to model collapse avoidance and rhythm integrity.
* **Distinction:**\
  Her taxonomy of leverage points provides the strategic grammar for phase-shifting interventions across nested systems. She anchors collapse modeling and rhythmic constraint design within the Ontology’s propagation logic.

#### **Fritjof Capra**

* **Integration Status:** Fully Integrated
* **Fields Linked:** Field 6 (Rhythm), Field 4 (Structure)
* **Ontological Function:**\
  Defines life as a networked phenomenon. Aligns ecological and organizational coherence through pattern, flow, and relational mapping.
* **Propagation Role:**\
  Enables transposition of systemic ecological insights into structural organizational propagation.
* **Distinction:**\
  Primary bridge between systems ecology and organizational systems logic—contextualizes propagation within living constraints.

#### **Elinor Ostrom**

* **Integration Status:** Fully Integrated
* **Fields Linked:** Field 2 (Polarity), Field 4 (Structure)
* **Ontological Function:**\
  Defines viable commons governance systems beyond binary market-state structures. Provides principles for distributed stewardship.
* **Propagation Role:**\
  Codifies how roles and rules interface to produce resilient systems within complex sociopolitical ecologies.
* **Distinction:**\
  Her polycentric governance model is foundational for distributed structural coherence and pluralistic propagation.

#### **Kate Raworth**

* **Integration Status:** Fully Integrated
* **Fields Linked:** Field 6 (Rhythm), Field 2 (Polarity)
* **Ontological Function:**\
  Translates planetary boundaries and social thresholds into an actionable provisioning grammar.
* **Propagation Role:**\
  Provides visual syntax and systems logic for harmonizing ecological ceilings with social foundations.
* **Distinction:**\
  Her doughnut model is the only framework that integrates dual-boundary coherence into design systems.
