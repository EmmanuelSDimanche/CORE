# Appendix A — Epistemic Lineage and Structural Contributions

**Purpose and Role**\
Appendix A defines the epistemic lineage of the CORE Ontology through functional contribution, not historical citation. CORE emerges through ontological recursion, not conceptual synthesis.  It holds only those figures whose structural logic is presently active in the design, propagation, or recursive coherence of the 7-Field Architecture. This is not a bibliography. Its meant to be a **symbolic map of embedded epistemic functions**.

**Inclusion Prerequisites (All Entries)**\
A figure is included only if:

1. **Field Activation**: Their work affirms a principle structurally embedded in one or more canonical Fields of the 7-Field Ontology.
2. **Current Integration**: Their contribution is _active_ in the current version of CORE’s Ontology (v0.0.1+), not merely inspirational or historical.



**Structural Thresholds for Inclusion**

All entries must satisfy the following:

* **Propagation Function**: They must _generate_, _translate_, _scale_, or _bound_ systemic coherence.
* **Symbolic Distinction**: Their contribution must be structurally unique—no redundancies or overlaps.
* **Ontological Activation**: They must currently shape or scaffold one or more Fields within CORE. Future potential is not sufficient.



**Integration Status Categories**\
Each entry is designated as:

* **Fully Integrated**: The figure’s structural logic is embedded in the Ontology and informs active propagation across one or more Fields.
* **Referenced or Resonant**: The figure’s ideas support or contextualize CORE’s logic but do not define its propagation grammar.



**Structural Organization (Sub-Pages)**\
Entries are organized not by discipline or chronology, but by _epistemic function_:

* **A.1 — Ontological Generators**: Define the substrate of coherence.
* **A.2 — Architects of Propagation**: Design systems of scale, role, and recursion.
* **A.3 — Symbolic Integrators**: Mediate meaning, feedback, and reflexivity.
* **A.4 — Constraint Codifiers**: Translate CORE into planetary, economic, and cultural conditions.
