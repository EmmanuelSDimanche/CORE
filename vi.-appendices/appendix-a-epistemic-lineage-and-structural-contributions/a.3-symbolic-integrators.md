# A.3 — Symbolic Integrators

**Definition of Role:**\
This category includes those who steward the recursive maintenance of coherence through time—via meaning, feedback, language, and cognition. They are essential for the Ontology’s rhythmic function and identity continuity. Without symbolic integration, coherence decays.

**Inclusion Criteria:**

* Must provide a mechanism for feedback, reflexivity, or symbolic meaning.
* Must clarify how identity is preserved or transmitted systemically.
* Must directly inform Field 5 (Bridge) and/or Field 6 (Rhythm).
* Must operate within symbolic recursion or communication infrastructure—not only behavioral or instrumental logic

* **Integration Status:** Fully Integrated
* **Fields Linked:** Field 6 (Rhythm), Field 5 (Bridge)
* **Ontological Function:**\
  Develops soft systems logic to support recursive learning and institutional adaptation. Translates purpose into symbolic feedback architectures.
* **Propagation Role:**\
  Maintains coherence through time by structuring feedback loops that preserve identity and enable systemic intelligence.
* **Distinction:**\
  Extends Ackoff’s telic design into reflexive organizational learning, ensuring continuity through adaptive symbolic infrastructure.

These figures contribute symbolic nuance and conceptual resonance but do not meet the structural threshold for canonical integration at v0.0.1–0.0.7. Their insights inform pattern coherence, reflexivity, and trans-contextual awareness, but are not embedded in current propagation logic.
