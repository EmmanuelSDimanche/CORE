# Layered Ontological Network Glossary

(Organized by Layer)

## Foundational Layer

_Immutable commitments and principles — define what must always be true for any life-aligned system._

* Foundational Layer: The universal, context-free layer of the ontological network. Contains only immutable commitments and principles that must be true for any coherent system. Serves as the ontological “source code” constraining all downstream layers.
* Ontological Commitments: Axiomatic constraints describing what must be true for a system to be coherent. These commitments define the foundational nature of reality, purpose, structure, and life-alignment.
* Epistemic Commitments: Principles governing the creation, validation, and stewardship of knowledge within the ontological framework. Ensure that all reasoning and knowledge claims are consistent with the Foundational Layer.
* Core Commitments for Systemic Integrity: The seven primary ontological commitments (e.g., Reality is Self-Configuring, Telic Core, Form Precedes Function, etc.) that define the universal conditions of systemic coherence.
* Propagation Clause (+1): A meta-commitment ensuring that the commitments themselves can be coherently replicated across scales and contexts without degradation or drift.
* Structural Inheritance: The rule that lower layers must fully comply with the Foundational commitments, prohibiting any contradictions.

## Core Layer

Expresses the Foundational commitments as a structural design grammar.

* Core Layer: The bridging layer between universal principles and applied contexts. Translates immutable commitments into an operational grammar for system design.
* Structural Grammar: The formalized set of structural patterns used to instantiate the Foundational commitments in real systems.
* The 7FRA7— 7 Fields Recursive Architecture: The primary structural grammar of the Core Layer. COHERE uses 7FRA to express its Foundational Layer commitments as a recursive, repeatable design grammar across all scales.
* The CORE ontology (**Coherent Organization of Relational Economies**) defines the structural grammar for aligning organizations and value flows across interdependent systems. CORE encodes the principles of systemic coherence into a repeatable design pattern for applied domains.
* Field Stabilization: The process of fully defining a Field in the Core Layer so it can be reliably applied without redefinition at the Domain Layer.
* Activation Criteria: The explicit conditions under which a Field is considered “active” in a real-world system.
* Coherence Audit: A structural evaluation to ensure a system’s design and operation remain in alignment with the Core grammar and Foundational commitments.
* Downward Constraint: The unidirectional governance of logic and structure from the Core Layer to the Domain Layer.

### Domain Layer

Context-specific applications inheriting the Core grammar.

* Domain Layer: The application layer where the Core grammar is adapted to specific contexts, sectors, or bioregions. Contains protocols, governance models, and operational templates.
* Domain Application: A concrete instantiation of the Core grammar in a bounded real-world context.
* Pilot: A bounded trial of a Domain Application to test coherence and performance before full-scale propagation.
* Protocol: A codified set of actions or rules in the Domain Layer, derived from and constrained by the Core grammar.
* Contextual Adaptation: The tailoring of Core grammar to a specific domain while maintaining structural integrity.

### Cross-Layer & Governance Terms

* Upward Feedback: The reporting of application data from Domain to Core to Foundational layers for validation purposes only (no direct alteration upstream).
* Version Lock Criteria: The defined conditions under which a layer’s logic is considered stable and locked from further change except through formal revision processes.
* Epistemic Stewardship: The governance function responsible for preserving the integrity of the ontology across layers, overseeing versioning, and integrating validated insights.
* Readiness Criteria: Layer-specific checks for structural, relational, and epistemic stability before advancing to new versions or enabling propagation.
* Failure Containment: The ability to localize failures to the layer in which they occur without compromising upstream layers.
* Ontological Drift: The gradual loss of structural alignment with Foundational commitments due to uncontrolled changes or poor stewardship.

### Change History & Evolution Terms

* **Change Log**\
  A persistent, version-controlled record of all modifications to glossary terms and layer definitions. Each entry includes the term affected, the exact change made, the version number, the date of modification, the author or steward responsible, and a short rationale for the change. The Change Log functions as the authoritative historical ledger for the ontology’s evolution, ensuring all updates are traceable, auditable, and reversible.
* **Review & Approval Protocol**\
  A formal governance process that must be completed before any modification to glossary terms, definitions, or structural layer descriptions can be published in an official release. This process requires: (1) submission of a change proposal with rationale, (2) review by at least two designated epistemic stewards, (3) validation against Foundational commitments and Core grammar, and (4) majority approval from the stewardship council. No term changes are permitted outside of this process.

### Term Retirement & Depreciation Terms

* **Retirement Protocol**\
  The structured process for permanently removing a glossary term from active use within the ontology. Retirement is triggered when a term is either: (1) structurally incompatible with the Foundational commitments, (2) superseded by a more precise or coherent term, or (3) rendered irrelevant by evolution of the Core grammar. The process includes formal review, public notice, archival of the retired term in the Change Log, and the assignment of any necessary cross-references to its successor term.
* **Deprecation Status**\
  A transitional classification applied to a glossary term that has been superseded but remains temporarily present in the ontology for backward compatibility. Deprecated terms must include a reference to the replacement term and will be fully retired after one major ontology version cycle. The Deprecation Status ensures continuity for users during version transitions while signaling the need to update to the preferred terminology.
