# Version Readiness = Application Readiness

Each version of CORE marks a shift in what becomes possible for real-world use. As new fields stabilize, the Ontology gains precision in its ability to support strategic alignment, system diagnostics, and operational coherence. COREâ€™s versioning logic defines when and how value becomes active in an organizational context.

For a full breakdown of how each version supports deployment, stakeholder onboarding, and system-wide architecture assessments, refer to the section: **Versioning Milestones and Business Activation**.
