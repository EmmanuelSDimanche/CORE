# Propagation Logic

Regenerative systems do not emerge from structure alone.\
They must be perceived, understood, and held by agents capable of stewarding coherence.

This requires not just symbolic infrastructure, but symbolic capacity.

**Consciousness as Substrate, Perception as Gate**

CORE affirms that all systems are modulations of universal mind.\
Every structure is a symbolic expression of telos: consciousness shaped through form.

However, the presence of consciousness does not guarantee perceptual coherence.\
What varies is the degree to which consciousness can perceive pattern, metabolize tension, and align with internal purpose.

**Wilberâ€™s Integral and Epistemic Stratification**

Human systems are not held from a single symbolic baseline.\
Consciousness differentiates across stages of complexity, reflexivity, and coherence capacity.\
This variation shapes what individuals and collectives can perceive, hold, and enact.

Systems with diverse epistemic conditions face distinct challenges:

* What is visible to one agent may be invisible to another.
* Feedback interpreted as coherence by one node may be destabilizing to another.
* Alignment cannot be assumed. It must be scaffolded across perceptual gradients.

This is not a problem to be solved. It is a structural reality to be designed for.

**Relational Thresholds and Symbolic Resolution**

To participate in regenerative design, an agent must reach a relational threshold.\
This includes the capacity to:

* Recognize telos as structural.
* Hold polarities without immediate resolution.
* Respond to feedback without collapse.

All humans possess coherence as a condition of being.\
What differs is the resolution at which coherence becomes perceptible, interpretable, and actionable.

Regenerative systems must design for this difference without reducing the pattern.

**Implication for CORE**

CORE is not only a grammar of design.\
It is a transmission medium **for perceived coherence**, designed to operate across:

* Multiple epistemic baselines
* Differentiated symbolic capacities
* Varying levels of developmental integration

It enables:

* Systems to hold form without enforcing uniformity
* Individuals to participate meaningfully without requiring symbolic mastery
* Networks to propagate coherence across heterogeneous perception fields

**Design Rule: Meet the Field Where It Is Without Lowering the Pattern**

Regenerative systems must speak to multiple levels of mind while holding one grammar.\
CORE allows complexity without confusion and simplicity without collapse.

This is how a symbolic ontology becomes a distributed architecture for coherence.
