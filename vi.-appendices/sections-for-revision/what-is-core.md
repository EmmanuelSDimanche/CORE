# WHAT is CORE?

## Ontological Framework

The 7-Field Architecture is the foundational design grammar of the CORE Ontology. It defines the structural minimum required for any regenerative system to maintain coherence, adapt over time, and propagate itself without fragmentation or loss of integrity. It is not a model or framework. It is a symbolic architecture: a universal pattern derived from life’s own recursive design logic.

All living systems, whether ecological, biological, or organizational, require structure to sustain function. But not all structures produce coherence. The 7-Field Architecture encodes a specific kind of structure: one that allows complexity to self-organize, trust to circulate, and life to regenerate across scales.

Each of the seven fields performs a distinct systemic function. Together, they form a closed propagation loop that ensures coherence is not held in any one element, but in the relational grammar between all. This architecture is **non-modular** and **non-arbitrary**. No field can be removed without collapse. No field can be added without redundancy or drift. It is the ontological genome of regenerative design.

The 7-Field Architecture holds:

* **Form before function**: Systems cannot act coherently without first being coherently structured.
* **Recursion over repetition**: Each field operates fractally, reappearing at every scale of system life.
* **Symbolic constraint**: The architecture constrains expression to maintain integrity, but does not determine content.

This is the “What” of the system: the underlying architecture that enables distributed coherence, scalable trust, and life-aligned design. Any system aspiring to regenerative coherence may benefit from being mapped through this architecture, which offers a structural pattern aligned with life’s own logic.  Attempts to bypass or substitute this pattern often lead to forms of systemic fragility, incoherence, or replication that may drift from regenerative integrity

In the CORE Ontology, the 7-Field Architecture is the **source pattern**—the structural scaffold upon which all function, flow, and evolution depend. It is the DNA of regenerative economies.
