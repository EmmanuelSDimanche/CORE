# Epistemic Lineage and Applied Influences

<mark style="color:orange;">**\<THIS SECTION IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION>**</mark>

The symbolic architecture of CORE is shaped by a lineage of thinkers whose work spans systems theory, enterprise design, epistemology, and regenerative economics. These influences do not constitute its ontological foundation, but rather inform the structure, coherence, and practical expressivity of the framework.

**Russell Ackoff**\
&#xNAN;_&#x44;omains:_ Systems Design, Purpose, Goal, Objective, Ideal, Feedback, Planning Logic\
&#xNAN;_&#x52;elevance:_

* Defined the distinction between Ideal, Goal, and Objective in purposeful systems
* Introduced circular feedback loops for learning and drift correction
* Anchored systems design in purpose and telos

**Jamshid Gharajedaghi**\
&#xNAN;_&#x44;omains:_ Interdependence, Function, Organizational Architecture, Systems Design\
&#xNAN;_&#x52;elevance:_

* Extended Ackoff’s logic into enterprise-level systems
* Emphasized functional alignment and structural adaptation
* Introduced interdependent role logic and dynamic layering

**Verna Allee**\
&#xNAN;_&#x44;omains:_ Value Networks, Stakeholder Contribution, Intangible Assets\
&#xNAN;_&#x52;elevance:_

* Framed organizations as value-creating networks
* Mapped relational flows beyond financial exchange
* Highlighted the importance of non-monetary value

**John Pourdehnad**\
&#xNAN;_&#x44;omains:_ Organizational Learning, Feedback Loops, Adaptive Maturity\
&#xNAN;_&#x52;elevance:_

* Developed soft systems logic for recursive learning
* Focused on feedback architectures for organizational intelligence
* Applied Ackoff’s principles to institutional evolution

**Tom Graves**\
&#xNAN;_&#x44;omains:_ Enterprise Coherence, Ontological Clarity, Structural Alignment\
&#xNAN;_&#x52;elevance:_

* Treated the enterprise as a relational field
* Aligned meaning, value, and behavior through systemic mapping
* Defined coherence as the primary diagnostic axis for enterprise health

**Ken Wilber**\
&#xNAN;_&#x44;omains:_ Developmental Models, Integral Logic\
&#xNAN;_&#x52;elevance:_

* Introduced multiperspectival modeling across scales and dimensions
* Mapped individual and collective development across quadrants
* Useful in diagnosing epistemic position and development maturity

**Donella Meadows**\
&#xNAN;_&#x44;omains:_ Systems Modeling, Leverage Points, Resilience Logic\
&#xNAN;_&#x52;elevance:_

* Articulated leverage points in complex systems
* Modeled collapse scenarios through feedback failure
* Her clarity on bounded systems and systemic delay informs Field dynamics

**Fritjof Capra**\
&#xNAN;_&#x44;omains:_ Systems Ecology, Network Thinking\
&#xNAN;_&#x52;elevance:_

* Defined ecosystems as patterns of organization
* Created bridges between biological systems and organizational logic
* Positioned life as a systemic phenomenon of flow and feedback

**Elinor Ostrom**\
&#xNAN;_&#x44;omains:_ Commons Governance, Polycentric Systems\
&#xNAN;_&#x52;elevance:_

* Demonstrated the viability of shared governance beyond state-market duality
* Offered structural principles for distributed stewardship
* Her principles inform CORE’s approach to Role and Structure fields

**Nora Bateson**\
&#xNAN;_&#x44;omains:_ Warm Data, Contextual Knowledge, Relational Epistemology\
&#xNAN;_&#x52;elevance:_

* Emphasized symmathesy: mutual learning through systemic interaction
* Brought forward the concept of trans-contextual coherence
* Extended systemic logic into cultural and affective domains

**Edgar Morin**\
&#xNAN;_&#x44;omains:_ Complexity Theory, Dialogics, System Archetypes\
&#xNAN;_&#x52;elevance:_

* Articulated recursive causality and system self-production
* Challenged linear logic with integrative, paradox-holding frameworks
* Provided tools for diagnosing the boundaries of coherence

**Herman Daly**\
&#xNAN;_&#x44;omains:_ Steady-State Economics, Ecological Boundaries\
&#xNAN;_&#x52;elevance:_

* Distinguished growth from development
* Defined sustainability in terms of biophysical throughput
* Important corrector to abstraction-based economic design

**Kate Raworth**\
&#xNAN;_&#x44;omains:_ Doughnut Economics, Biophysical Boundaries\
&#xNAN;_&#x52;elevance:_

* Proposed visual grammar for economic sufficiency
* Bridged planetary boundaries with social thresholds
* Useful for contextual framing of provisioning design

**Daniel Christian Wahl**\
&#xNAN;_&#x44;omains:_ Regenerative Design, Bioregional Culture\
&#xNAN;_&#x52;elevance:_

* Framed design as a tool for ecological alignment
* Brought regenerative logic into cultural narratives
* Serves as a connector between epistemology and bioregional action
