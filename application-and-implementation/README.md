# Application & Implementation

<mark style="color:orange;">**\<THIS SECTION IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION>**</mark>

Presently, CORE operates as a recursive system structured to hold and propagate coherence. In its current application, the Ontology functions as an AI-assisted diagnostic tool for assessing and regenerating alignment across complex systems.

Embedding the 7-Field Architecture into AI logic enables high-fidelity coherence checks within organizational structures, project architectures, and systemic strategies. This use supports relational sense-making by surfacing tensions, identifying ontological misalignments, and guiding symbolic realignment.

The tooling enables:

* Analysis of organizational misalignment and operational breakdowns
* Detection of hidden tradeoffs and dysfunctional communication patterns
* Evaluation of disconnects between mission statements and actual performance
* Readiness assessment for expansion across teams,  partnerships or organizational ecosystems.

The AI holds no agency. It reflects the Ontologyâ€™s function by supporting coherence, signaling misalignment, and enabling regenerative propagation through symbolic precision.

This configuration remains provisional. It adapts through iteration and feedback. The application demonstrates that CORE functions not only as ontological scaffolding, but as a diagnostic grammar for coherence in live systems.
