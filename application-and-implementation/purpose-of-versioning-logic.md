# Purpose of Versioning Logic

Versioning in CORE does not track chronological updates or feature progression. It defines recursive activation phases aligned with the 7-Field Architecture and the system’s ontogenetic development.

Each version represents a symbolic stage in the system’s evolution—from pure potential to structured form to functional coherence and eventual propagation. \
**This progression is not additive. It is integrative**. Each phase embeds a distinct epistemology that activates the ontological logic of a specific field.

The versioning logic makes visible how CORE gains structural integrity over time. It encodes not only what changes, but why it matters. It ensures that the system evolves through constraint, recursion, and coherence instead of improvisation.

Versioning also supports clarity for contributors, funders, and implementers. It defines what is ready, what is forming, and what remains beyond the current threshold of coherence.
