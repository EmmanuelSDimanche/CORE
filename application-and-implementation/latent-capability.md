# Latent Capability

CORE contains structural features that, if technically activated, could already support high-value applications across strategy, operations, and governance. While some functions require human interpretation, others could run at scale with existing inputs. Specifically:

* **Structural Mapping**: Teams and organizations could assess how well their purpose, strategy, and roles align with a regenerative design structure—identifying blind spots or breakdowns in execution.
* **Symbolic Insight Translation**: With trained facilitators, CORE could help interpret deeper purpose signals and clarify where teams may be operating from outdated assumptions or misaligned goals.
* **Limited Propagation Modeling**: While not yet capable of full ecosystem simulation, CORE could model how decisions or structural changes affect coherence within and between teams.
* **Governance Feedback Alignment**: With strong data hygiene and operational integrity, organizations could evaluate how well their feedback loops, decision flows, and resourcing align with regenerative principles.
* **Recursive Auditing (With Oversight)**: The system can highlight when internal elements are drifting from purpose or becoming misaligned—but this still requires human review to interpret and apply effectively.

These capabilities do not depend on future versions of the ontology. They exist today. What’s missing is the technical stack and integration capacity to automate them at scale.
