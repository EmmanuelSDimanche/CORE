# Where We Came From

Industrial and financial economies were built on a powerful grammar: **Double-entry accounting.**

Invented in the 15th century, it encoded trust and surplus as symmetrical entries, making value legible through balance. Every entry had a mirror. Every account had to align.

This Newtonian mirror-logic ledger gave economies memory, symmetry, and scale. It made trust durable, roles visible, and coordination possible across vast distances and time.\
\
Its genius was in encoding balance, commitment, and propagation into symbolic form.\
\
This logic enabled firms, financial systems, and global scale. For centuries, it enabled a limited form of economic coherence, which was sufficient for the industrial age.

The form was the first economic grammar to enable scalability across distance, time, and institutional boundaries.\
\
But its symmetry came at a cost:

* **It ignores** ecological thresholds
* **It is blind to** relational surplus
* **It does not account for trust** as a relational living dynamic
* **It flattens flow** into financial return
* **It erases care** as a structuring force

It collapses value into abstraction, into what can be owned, priced, and extracted. It seeds entropy structurally by erasing the very dynamics that generate life.

This is why entire forests are clear-cut and rivers rerouted today, because the ledger accounts destruction as gains.\
\
The grammar it follows translates depletion into profit, and treats what it is blind to as having no value at all.\
\
\
This is how abstraction becomes violence.\
This is how all wars become economic paradise...
