# Why Do Our Economies Lack Coherence?

> _“The major problems in the world are the result of the difference between how nature works and how people think.” —_ **Gregory Bateson**

**Human designed systems fail not from a lack of technology but from a lack of coherence. CORE provides the structure to regenerate coherence at every scale.**

The dominant economies of today are not designed to cohere.\
They scale without sense, move without rhythm, grow without grounding.

Markets track price, but not value.\
Financial systems manage scarcity, but cannot hold surplus.\
Institutions measure performance, but collapse without shared purpose.\
\
This is not a tooling problem.\
It is a breakdown in the structure of meaning.\
An ontological failure\
\
There is no grammar for regenerative alignment.

## Why Grammar Matters

Systems cannot function without coherence.\
Institutions cannot govern without shared language.\
Change cannot propagate without legibility.

Grammar is not about language.\
It is the invisible architecture of meaning.\
It determines what can be seen, said, and done before anything happens.

What grammar cannot express, a culture, a whole cannot perceive.\
What it cannot hold, a system cannot steward.\
What it does not encode, a world cannot propagate.

The current economic grammar encodes fragmentation.\
It collapses trust into compliance, reduces value to price, and renders life as input.\
It cannot express care, hold surplus, or propagate coherence.

CORE restores grammar as a regenerative force.\
It is a symbolic substrate that allows life to re-enter the structure of our economies and networked organizations along territories.
