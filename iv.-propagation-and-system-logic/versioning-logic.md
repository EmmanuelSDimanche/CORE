# Versioning Logic

The CORE Ontology does not evolve through linear development. Its structure emerges through recursive ontogenesis. Each version marks a distinct phase of activation, aligned with the architecture of living systems. Versioning does not track time. It expresses structural readiness, ontological integration, and developmental alignment.

Each sub-phase (v0.0.x) integrates a specific epistemology. Geometry, biology, topology, ecology, and semantics are not layered on top of each other. They are embedded into the functional logic of the system. Coherence results from constraint, not accumulation.

Versioning encodes symbolic stages in the systemâ€™s evolution. These stages follow a life pattern: seed, form, function, flow, maturation, and regeneration. Each version reflects a threshold that must be crossed before the next becomes structurally viable.

This logic ensures that CORE does not grow by adding features. It gains depth by integrating epistemic logic into architectural function. Each phase embeds a grammar of life, not a stack of tools. Through versioning, the Ontology deepens coherence rather than expands surface complexity.
