# Versioning Logic

The COHERE Ontology does not evolve by linear development or feature addition. Its form emerges through recursive ontogenesis. Each version marks a distinct phase of activation aligned with the logic of living systems.

Versioning expresses structural readiness, ontological integration, and developmental alignment. It does not track time. It tracks thresholds of coherence.

Each sub-phase (v0.0.x) integrates a specific epistemology into the 7-Field Architecture. Geometry, biology, topology, ecology, and semantics are not added in sequence. They are metabolized into the structural function of the system. Coherence results from constraint, not accumulation.

Versioning encodes symbolic stages in the systemâ€™s life-pattern: seed, form, function, flow, maturation, and regeneration. Each version reflects a structural threshold that must be crossed before the next becomes viable.

This logic ensures that COHERE gains depth through integration, not complexity through addition. Each phase embeds a grammar of life into the Ontology itself. Versioning is how structural recursion becomes real.
