# The Path to System Maturation

<mark style="color:orange;">**\<THIS SECTION IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION>**</mark>

CORE itself is a living system, evolving through phases that mirror the development of all life:

**v0.0.0 (Information Phase)**

The system’s Essence is clarified as pure informational logic. It is a coherent seed code holding purpose and evolutionary intent. This stage is about potential and encoded direction, ensuring all future structure remains anchored and coherent.

**v0.1.0 (Form Phase)**

The 7-Field Architecture is established as a coherent static structure, a precise definition of the system’s minimum viable form. At this stage, the system is stable: it holds capacity but has no flow.

**v0.2.0 (Function Phase)**

The 7-Fold Process Code is integrated, activating the system’s capacity for sensing, decision-making, and movement. The system activates procedural coherence. Flow initiates but remains sequenced and non-adaptive. The architecture is functional but not yet living.

**v0.3.0 (Flow Phase)**

The system evolves into a recursive, living architecture: the 7 fields hold form, Care flows as the relational pulse, and Emergence appears as the fruiting outcome, as the visible harvest of coherence. The system is no longer static; it is alive, dynamic, and capable of self-propagation.

**v0.4–v0.9 (Maturation Phases)**

The system moves from theory to embodiment, each phase a necessary step in the maturation of a living system:

* v0.4: Prototyping\
  The system is tested in real-world conditions. Theory meets practice; the architecture is stress-tested, refined, and proven through lived cycles of provisioning, governance, and trust-building.\

* v0.5: Fractalization\
  The system’s pattern logic is recursively replicated across scales and contexts. The system demonstrates adaptability: it can be instantiated in different communities, bioregions, and domains without losing coherence.\

* v0.6: Ecosystem Integration\
  The system interfaces with external infrastructures: legal frameworks, technological platforms, economic instruments. It remains sovereign in its logic while interoperating with the broader world, ensuring relevance without compromise.\

* v0.7: Regenerative Intelligence\
  The system develops its capacity for self-sensing and adaptation. Feedback loops become intelligence systems; the architecture gains the capacity to track its own health, adjust flows, and regenerate capacity in response to signals.\

* v0.8: Cultural Codex\
  The system embeds itself in cultural narrative: stories, symbols, and shared meaning that transmit the logic across generations. It becomes more than a system; it becomes a living story, a cultural pattern language for regenerative economies.\

* v0.9: Generative Ecosystem\
  The system becomes a self-propagating field: a platform for the continuous emergence of new projects, relationships, and patterns. It is no longer a model to be applied; it is a living, generative ecosystem that seeds the next cycles of regenerative design.\


#### v1, v2, v3: Developmental Thresholds

These thresholds mark the system’s transition from theory to practice, from model to living field:

* v1: Operational Prototype\
  The system is tested, validated, and fully functional in a specific context. It demonstrates that regenerative economic design is possible and viable.\

* v2: Fractal Pattern Language\
  The system is adaptable across scales, cultures, and sectors. It becomes a design grammar, a replicable pattern that practitioners can use to instantiate regenerative systems without collapsing into rigid templates.\

* v3: Generative Platform\
  The system becomes an ecosystem: a living field of practitioners, projects, and regenerative economies that propagate themselves through shared logic, care, and coherence. The Ontology is no longer a static framework; it is an enabling condition for continuous regeneration.

The generational arc from industrial mechanics to regenerative coherence has initiated. This is an ontogenesis.\
