# structural inflection point

* **O7 Seed Horizon** – First propagation threshold.
  * Marks the point where the system has _coherent replication capability_.
  * It’s the **birth point** of new instances — the shift from self-maintenance to outward generativity.
  * Governance implication: This is when the **first new steward seats** can activate in sub-domains.
* **O8 Care Horizon** – First full sustainability threshold.
  * Marks the ability to _maintain multiple living instances in a coherent network_ over time.
  * This is **network metabolism** — the system proves it can nourish and protect what it seeds.
  * Governance implication: This is when **full councils** become viable without centralization collapse.
* **O13 Fruit Horizon** – Final generative threshold.
  * Marks the point of _full maturation and autonomous seeding of the next systemic cycle_.
  * This is **harvest and renewal** — the moment the system is not just sustaining, but **spawning coherent new systems without direct intervention**.
  * Governance implication: Stewardship shifts from operational to **legacy and succession**, ensuring telos continuity.

Recognizing these **“structural horizons”** within the maturity arc makes it clear these are **qualitatively different** from the other milestones, which are more linear developmental phases.
