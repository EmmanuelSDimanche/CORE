# COHERE 4-Part Maturity and Integration Index

**Syntax:**

```
Oindex . Gindex . Eindex . Iindex
```

**Index System Governance**\
The COHERE Ontological Maturity Index System (Oindex, Gindex, Eindex, Iindex) is a **quasi-immutable construct** under Prime Layer governance. Any change to its structure, formulas, thresholds, or semantics requires formal invocation of the Review & Approval Protocol, with lawful inheritance applied to all dependent layers and domains.

#### **1. Oindex — Ontology Maturity Level**

**Definition:** Tracks the structural maturity of an ontology along the COHERE **Base-12 milestone arc**.\
**Range:** 1 → Omax (Omax = 13).\
**Rule:** Each increment of Oindex represents the crossing of all twelve gates and the Integrator Review at that milestone.\
**Example:** O6 means the ontology is at milestone 6 (Rhythm phase) in the Base-12 sequence.

#### **2. Gindex — Gate Progression**

**Definition:** Tracks which gate within the current milestone has been passed.\
**Range:** 1 → 12 per milestone.\
**Rule:** Gates are sequential and must be completed in order. Advancement to the next milestone requires all twelve gates to be passed and the Integrator Review to be completed.\
**Example:** G4 means the ontology is at the fourth gate of its current milestone.

#### **3. Eindex — Epistemic Enrichment Level**

**Definition:** Tracks the depth of epistemology integration into the ontology. This operates orthogonally to Oindex.\
**Qualitative Markers:**

1. **Applied Experiment** — tested in a controlled, limited-scope pilot.
2. **Cultural Adoption** — embedded in participant norms, symbols, and shared narratives.
3. **Cross-Domain Integration** — replicated or integrated into another active layer/system.
4. **Generative Replication** — used to seed new, self-propagating instances without direct stewardship.\
   **Example:** E3 means the ontology has successfully integrated at least one epistemology to the **Cross-Domain Integration** depth.

#### **4. Iindex — Integration Index**

**Definition:** Tracks the extent and stability of integration between ontology and epistemology.\
**Formula:**

```
Iindex = (Oindex ÷ Omax) × (Ematurity ÷ Emax)
```

Where:

* **Oindex** = current ontology milestone number.
* **Omax** = maximum ontology milestone (13).
* **Ematurity** = total of the Eindex scores for all epistemologies currently integrated into the ontology.
* **Emax** = maximum possible Ematurity score if all integrated epistemologies were at full depth.

**Threshold Bands:**

* **Minimum (0.00):** No epistemologies integrated or ontology is at Oindex 1.
* **Low (0.01–0.25):** Early integration — minimal epistemic depth relative to ontological maturity.
* **Moderate (0.26–0.50):** Balanced growth — epistemic depth is keeping pace with ontology milestones.
* **High (0.51–0.75):** Strong integration — ontology and epistemology are maturing in close synchrony.
* **Optimal (0.76–1.00):** Full integration — ontology is mature and all integrated epistemologies are at maximum depth.

**Purpose:**

* Normalizes integration progress so that early-stage ontologies cannot show inflated maturity from rapid but shallow integrations.
* Shows integration health as a coupled measure of **ontological stability** and **epistemic depth**.
* Works fractally at ontology, domain, master-domain, and network levels.

#### **5. Example State Expression**

```
O6 . G4 . E2 . I0.42
```

This means:

* Ontology is at **Oindex 6** (Rhythm milestone).
* Has passed **Gate 4** in that milestone.
* Has integrated at least one epistemology to **Eindex 2** (Cultural Adoption).
* The Integration Index is **0.42** (reflecting the current maturity relationship between ontology and epistemology).
