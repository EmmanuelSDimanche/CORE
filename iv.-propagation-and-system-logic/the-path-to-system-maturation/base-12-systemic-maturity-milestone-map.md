# Base-12 Systemic Maturity Milestone Map

The **base-12 systemic maturity milestone map** is locked to the COHERE sequencing (1–7 → 8 → 13) and culture.\
**Base-12 Milestones (V = Version / O = Ontology / G = Gate / E = Epistemic)**\
Each milestone = 12 gates (G1–G12) + 1 integrator review (I).\
Epistemic markers (E) track enrichment within each gate.

**O1 (Essence – Seed Code Defined)**

* G1 Essence clarity locked (Prime commitments).
* G2 Safeguard constraints validated.
* G3 Telos encoded in base-12 geometry.
* G4 Relational map to 7FRA fixed.
* G5 Bridge to Foundational layer set.
* G6 Rhythm cadence defined.
* G7 Seed replication concept framed.
* G8 Stewardship role for Prime layer named.
* G9 Epistemic review sync with commitments.
* G10 Constraint clause conformance check.
* G11 Ontology ID/version syntax frozen.
* G12 Internal coherence audit passed.
* I → Prime integrator review.

**O2 (Form – Foundational Grammar Fixed)**

* G1 7FRA field definitions locked.
* G2 Field constraints validated.
* G3 Inter-field bridge rules embedded.
* G4 Recursive propagation rules stated.
* G5 Alignment with Prime layer confirmed.
* G6 Governance handshakes defined.
* G7 Stewardship role for Foundational layer named.
* G8 External ontology interface spec set.
* G9 Epistemic enrichment baseline defined.
* G10 Diagnostic trigger list complete.
* G11 Audit cadence set.
* G12 Field activation map frozen.
* I → Foundational integrator review.

**O3 (Function – Core Grammar Activation)**

* G1 Applied ontology seed code defined.
* G2 Field-to-function mapping validated.
* G3 Pattern propagation logic tested.
* G4 Stewardship role for Core layer named.
* G5 Downward inheritance compliance check.
* G6 Bridge to Domain layer functional.
* G7 Rhythm cadence operational.
* G8 Resource flow grammar embedded.
* G9 External integration protocol tested.
* G10 Epistemic signals mapped.
* G11 Context adaptation protocol defined.
* G12 Activation governance tested.
* I → Core integrator review.

**O4 (Flow – Domain Activation)**

* G1 Domain ontology seed defined.
* G2 Alignment with Core layer grammar confirmed.
* G3 Role and load-bearing structure mapped.
* G4 Bridge to other domains tested.
* G5 Rhythm cycles proven.
* G6 Stewardship role for domain named.
* G7 Care governance activated.
* G8 Feedback loops operational.
* G9 Epistemic signals gathered.
* G10 Domain audit passed.
* G11 External interface live.
* G12 Replication readiness confirmed.
* I → Domain integrator review.

**O5–O7 (Bridge → Rhythm → Seed)**\
Follow same 12-gate template, but tied to inter-domain governance, temporal governance, and propagation governance respectively.

**O8 (Care – Network Stewardship)**\
First complete ring of domains; Care-phase governance operational.

**O13 (Fruit – Master-Domain Integration)**\
6+1 domains fully integrated; structural universality achieved.
