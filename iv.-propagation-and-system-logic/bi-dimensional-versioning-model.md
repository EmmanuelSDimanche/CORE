# Bi-Dimensional Versioning Model

The **COHERE Bi-Dimensional Versioning Model** formalizes the distinction between _ontological stability_ and _epistemic richness_ within the governance of the layered ontology network. This distinction resolves the limitations of a mono-dimensional versioning scheme by ensuring that structural maturity and knowledge integration are both explicitly tracked yet governed by different rules.

#### **1. Ontological Dimension**

The ontological dimension measures the structural maturity of the Core Layer’s grammar—whether 7FRA, CORE, or any future Core Layer ontology. Ontological version numbers indicate the readiness of the structural architecture to reliably propagate into the Domain Layer without risk of systemic incoherence.

**Key Characteristics:**

* Publicly declared as the primary version number (e.g., **v0.3.0**).
* Determined by the lowest Field version within the ontology.
* Increments only when a structural audit confirms that:
  1. All Fields meet their activation constraints.
  2. The architecture maintains integrity under cross-Field stress testing.
* Locked upon reaching **v0.3.0** (full Field activation), after which no ontological version increase occurs without a redesign of the grammar itself.

#### **2. Epistemic Dimension**

The epistemic dimension measures the integration of new knowledge into the **stable** ontological structure. This is tracked through an **E-index** appended to the ontological version number (e.g., **v0.3.0-E7**).

**Key Characteristics:**

* Infinite in scope—there is no upper bound to epistemic enrichment.
* Increments occur whenever a new epistemology or body of knowledge is validated for integration.
* Governed by the **Review & Approval Protocol** for epistemic integration.
* Does not trigger a structural audit unless:
  1. The integration affects a Field’s activation constraint.
  2. The Safeguard Clause is invoked, requiring a full ontological review.

#### **3. Governance Interlock**

The bi-dimensional model is designed to ensure that **epistemic growth** never compromises **ontological stability**:

* **Ontological increments** require a complete structural revalidation.
* **Epistemic increments** require only integration validation unless they impact activation constraints, in which case they are treated as ontological gates.
* The Safeguard Clause (Section 4.5) provides the lawful mechanism for upward feedback from Domain Layer applications to trigger a Core Layer review when epistemic changes challenge structural assumptions.

#### **4. Strategic Benefits**

* **Preserves Core Integrity:** Ontological stability is never overstated.
* **Encourages Continuous Learning:** Epistemic enrichment can progress without destabilizing the foundational grammar.
* **Supports Infinite Depth:** The E-index allows for unbounded integration of knowledge systems.
* **Transparent Governance:** Clear rules exist for when enrichment becomes a structural change.
