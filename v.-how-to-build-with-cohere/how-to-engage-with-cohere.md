# How to Engage With COHERE

COHERE provides a structural grammar for human designed regenerative systems. The following invitations are open for engagement, contribution, or support.

**1. Alignment Sessions**\
For teams, networks, and initiatives seeking coherence.\
These sessions surface structural tensions, clarify roles, and map system design using the 7-Field Architecture.

→ _Request &#x61;_&#x6E; Alignment Session to apply COHERE within your project or organization.

**2a. Epistemic Contributions**\
Researchers and systems thinkers can contribute to the Ontology by sharing aligned frameworks, models, or conceptual anchors.\
Valid contributions are reviewed and mapped directly into COHERE's structural logic.

→ _Reach-out if you work with geometry, recursion, systemic logic, or regenerative design._

**2b. Tooling Integration**\
For developers, protocol architects, and infrastructure stewards.\
COHERE provides a symbolic foundation; your tools can carry it into operational form.\
This includes platforms, data models, governance protocols, and coordination layers.\
&#xNAN;_→ Reach out to explore integration possibilities._

**3. Funding and Resourcing**\
For funders focused on systems change and regenerative infrastructure.\
Supporting COHERE helps stabilize the ontology, extend its reach, and enable practical implementations across domains.

→ Connect to align funding with current phase needs and propagation scope.
