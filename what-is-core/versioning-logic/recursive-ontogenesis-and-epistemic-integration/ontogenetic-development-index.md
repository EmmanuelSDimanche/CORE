# Ontogenetic Development Index

<mark style="color:orange;">**\<THIS SECTION IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION>**</mark>

The Ontogenetic Development Index defines the methodology for tracking how CORE integrates distinct epistemological bodies into its recursive architecture. Unlike a linear roadmap, this index maps the depth and maturity of ontological integration within each Field, phase, and version.

This approach ensures that the development of CORE is not defined by feature addition, but by internal coherence and recursive validation of each structural layer.

**Three Dimensions of Indexing**

1. **Integration Depth**
   * _Observed_: The epistemology is noted and influences interpretation.
   * _Aligned_: Its symbolic grammar is mapped to the appropriate Field logic.
   * _Activated_: The Field’s function structurally incorporates the epistemic logic.
   * _Instrumented_: The epistemology enables formal diagnosis or tooling.
2. **Propagation Threshold**
   * Does the epistemic logic sustain coherence when applied recursively?
   * Can it operate across roles, scales, and domains?
   * Can the associated Field operate across roles, scales, and domains?
3. **Version Anchoring**
   * Each version (e.g., v0.0.3) is considered “open” until all contributing epistemologies reach the _Activated_ threshold.
   * Full convergence at _Instrumented_ closes the phase and permits stabilization toward the next version.

**Rationale for the Indexing Methodology**

Without this index, versioning would default to arbitrary progress markers or aesthetic benchmarks. Instead, each shift in version corresponds to an ontological reality: the activation of structural capacity through epistemic convergence. The index maintains CORE’s accountability to its function as a regenerative architecture, structured by recursive logic rather than ideological abstraction.
