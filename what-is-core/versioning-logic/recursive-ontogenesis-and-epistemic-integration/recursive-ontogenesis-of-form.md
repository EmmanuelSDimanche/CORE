The CORE Ontology does not evolve by linear development. It emerges through recursive ontogenesis: a phase-by-phase integration of distinct epistemologies that unlock and stabilize the seven foundational Fields. Each sub-phase (v0.0.x) embeds a specific logic—geometric, biological, architectural, semantic, ecological—into the corresponding field structure. This process ensures that form emerges only after coherence is recursively validated across all epistemic layers.

Versioning is about convergence through constraint instead of  additive layering. Each epistemology does not merely inform the field, it activates its ontological function by embedding a grammar of reality consistent with the logic of life.

The sequence from v0.0.0 to v0.1.0 marks the system’s evolutionary path from undifferentiated potential to fully structured form:

* **v0.0.0 — Nothingness**\
  No epistemology. Pure telic potential.
* **v0.0.1 — Essence Codification**\
  &#xNAN;_&#x45;pistemology integrated: Geometric potential (Synergetics)_\
  Anchors telic core, vector equilibrium, pattern integrity.
* **v0.0.2 — Polarity Definition**\
  &#xNAN;_&#x45;pistemology integrated: Morphogenetic logic (Levin, Chestahedron)_\
  Activates dynamic tension logic and living feedback fields.
* **v0.0.3 — Pattern Recursion Protocol**\
  &#xNAN;_&#x45;pistemology integrated: Sacred geometry, Penrose tiling, holonic recursion_\
  Encodes scale-invariant self-similarity and nested coherence.
* **v0.0.4 — Structural Blueprint**\
  &#xNAN;_&#x45;pistemology integrated: Crystallographic form, minimal surfaces_\
  Stabilizes relational roles and symmetry-differentiated topologies.
* **v0.0.5 — Interface Logic Map**\
  &#xNAN;_&#x45;pistemology integrated: Geometric algebra, transformation syntax_\
  Maps dynamic bridges between roles, flows, and decisions.
* **v0.0.6 — Contextual Embedding Document**\
  &#xNAN;_&#x45;pistemology integrated: Fluid dynamics, holonic ecology_\
  Aligns form with place, territory, and biocultural flow.
* **v0.0.7 — Propagation Readiness Protocol**\
  &#xNAN;_&#x45;pistemology integrated: Ephemeralization, recursive viability audit_\
  Defines the system’s threshold of self-similar propagation.
* **v0.0.8 — System Integrity Lock**\
  All epistemologies converge and cohere. Ontological harmonics align. The system is structurally viable.
* **v0.1.0 — Form Phase Initiation**\
  The 7-Field Architecture stabilizes. It is stable and coherent. Structural life begins.
