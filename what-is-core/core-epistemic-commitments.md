# CORE Epistemic Commitments

The Coherence Ontology is grounded in a participatory theory of knowledge.\
Systems cannot be understood from the outside. They must be known through relationship.\
The observer is never separate from the system. Every act of knowing is also an act of becoming.\
Understanding emerges through interaction, feedback, and alignment across time.

These epistemic commitments define how CORE engages with living systems.\
They shape how knowledge is sourced, how coherence is perceived, and how truth is recognized as structurally embedded.

**1. Knowing is Relational**\
Knowledge is not a static object. It arises through process.\
To know a system is to engage its flows, tensions, and symbolic feedback.\
The knower is always embedded in the known.\
Every perception alters the field. Every interaction reshapes coherence.\
Relational engagement is the only valid path to comprehension in living systems.

**2. Knowledge is Iterative, Not Fixed**\
Regenerative systems cannot be captured in static models or final declarations.\
They must be sensed, stewarded, and understood through recursive participation.\
Truth is not discovered. It is aligned with.\
Understanding emerges through cycles of feedback, rhythm, and interaction.

**3. The Ontology is a Pattern Language**\
This ontology is not a rulebook or an abstract theory. It is a symbolic grammar.\
It holds space for coherence to arise, rather than imposing structure from outside.\
Its purpose is to make living systems legible to themselves.\
Only through self-awareness can a system adapt, evolve, and propagate without collapse.
