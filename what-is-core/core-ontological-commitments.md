# CORE Ontological Commitments

The Coherence Ontology is grounded in a set of explicit ontological commitments. These are formal claims about the nature of reality, systems, and design. They serve as the axiomatic substrate for all structural patterns, process codes, and systemic logic within this grammar.

These principles are drawn from systems science, ecological logic, cognitive theory, and symbolic metaphysics. They reflect a qualified monism: the understanding that all systems are symbolic expressions within a universally intelligible field of mind.

**1. Reality is a Self-Configuring, Self-Referential System**\
All phenomena emerge from within a closed, self-generating logic. There is no external source of structure, form, or purpose. Reality operates as a recursive pattern that encodes its own rules, dynamics, and direction of evolution. Every coherent system must generate its own structure and coherence from within.\
This defines the ontological boundary of viable design. Systems that rely on externally imposed structure or meaning collapse under fragmentation.

**2. Telic Core: Purpose is Intrinsic, Not Assigned**\
Every system carries an intrinsic telos, an internal orientation that shapes its structure and guides its formation. This is not an imposed goal but a self-originating intent. In CORE, telos is held in the Essence field, where it anchors identity, direction, and commitment.\
Telos is the attractor that allows coherence to emerge over time.

**3. Form Precedes Function**\
Structure defines the domain of possible function. A system cannot act regeneratively if its form is misaligned. This principle holds across all living systems: genetic code precedes expression, ecosystems form nested trophic flows, cognition emerges through structural scaffolding.\
The Coherence Ontology encodes this logic through the 7-Field Architecture, where structure is not a shell but the symbolic skeleton of capacity.

**4. Systems are Recursive and Fractal**\
Coherence must replicate across scale. Regenerative systems follow fractal recursion, from cells to cities, from teams to bioregions.\
Nested coherence is not optional. Local action must reinforce systemic alignment.\
The 7-Field pattern applies at every nested level of design.

**5. Coherence is Alignment with Lifeâ€™s Logic**\
A system is coherent when its Essence, Structure, and Field dynamics remain aligned within their relational context. Coherence is not imposed from the outside. It arises through resonance, when telos, pattern, and field generate mutual reinforcement.\
Coherence enables resilience, adaptability, and generativity across time.

**6. The Ontology as Design Grammar**\
This Ontology is not a model, toolkit, or belief system. It is a symbolic grammar, a design language for building systems that propagate coherence.\
Its purpose is to make regenerative alignment structurally possible. Systems that follow this grammar gain trust, capacity, and resilience. Systems that violate it fragment, externalize, and collapse.
