# Where Coherence Breaks

Coherence breaks before systems collapse. The early signs are rarely dramatic. Work continues. Meetings happen. Messages flow. But something begins to slip beneath the surface.

A team moves forward, but not together. A project expands, but no one agrees on what anchors it. A network grows faster than trust can keep up. Everyone is doing something useful, but the pieces stop adding up. Misunderstandings increase. Decisions get delayed or duplicated. Roles blur. Direction scatters.

These aren’t operational problems. They are structural. What fails is not effort or intention, but the deeper logic that holds the system together. When key functions are missing or out of sync, no amount of coordination can restore alignment. The system fragments while appearing to function.

This happens most often when growth outruns integration. A group tries to scale before clarifying its purpose. A structure is put in place before relationships stabilize. New efforts are launched without shared definitions. The system stretches beyond what it can hold. What once felt clear begins to feel scattered.

There are patterns behind these breakdowns. Coherence requires a set of distinct functions working together. Each one plays a role in holding identity, maintaining trust, aligning roles, and making sure the system doesn’t lose itself as it changes. When even one of these core functions is missing, systems begin to drift.

That drift shows up first in rhythm. Meetings feel rushed. Updates lose context. Decisions come without explanation. Then in structure—confusion about who holds what, and why. Over time, purpose fades from view. What started with clarity now moves on momentum alone.

**COHERE exists because this pattern of structural systemic disintegration is everywhere.** It gives language and structure to what many already feel: that systems often lose their center not through failure, but through unstructured growth. When that happens, coherence breaks. And once it breaks, it does not repair itself. It must be rebuilt through structure.
