# What COHERE Is Not

**COHERE is not** a platform, protocol, or economic stack.\
**It does not** provide provisioning mechanisms, exchange tools, or technical deployments. \
**It does not** replace governance frameworks or substitute for community design.

**COHERE operates as a pre-protocol layer.**\
It defines the symbolic architecture that precedes and shapes protocol design.\
It does not dictate how systems must be built. Rather, it ensures that whatever is built aligns structurally with life.

Most protocols fail not at the level of rules, but at the level of meaning. COHERE addresses that.\
It holds the coherence that protocols alone cannot generate.

**COHERE is a symbolic grammar.**\
It defines the underlying structure that allows regenerative systems to cohere, align, and evolve. It holds the architecture of meaning, but not the layers of implementation.

To build regenerative economies, COHERE must be integrated with frameworks for provisioning, exchange, governance, and data. It does not do this work by itself.

What it ensures is that the systems we build do not fracture, extract, or collapse under symbolic incoherence.
