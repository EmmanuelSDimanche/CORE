# What COHERE Enables

COHERE makes systems legible to themselves. It reveals what current tools erase.

COHERE is meant to enable:

* **Alignment to purpose** across teams and networks
* **Detection of leakage** in trust, surplus, and capacity
* **Reinvestment of surplus** through non-extractive flows
* **Regenerative provisioning** grounded in rhythm and care
* **Scalable coherence** from neighborhood to bioregion

COHERE functions as symbolic infrastructure. It offers a grammar designed to carry coherence, propagate care, and regenerate life.

INVITATION: BUILD WITH COHERENCE

If you are designing systems that aim to serve life but are limited by extractive defaults, COHERE offers a grammar to realign structure with purpose.

Whether you steward a team, a platform, a territory, or a networkâ€”\
you are invited to explore and help shape this next layer of symbolic infrastructure.

Begin with coherence. Start with COHERE.
