# COHERE as a Grammar of Coherence

The ledger need not be discarded. But it must be transcended. CORE offers the symbolic grammar to start that shift.\
It encodes coherence where the ledger encoded control.

Built on the CORE Frame:

* **Function** — Structure is purpose expressed through design
* **Operations** — Coherence enacted through rhythm, structure, agreements, and objectives
* **Roles** — Defined through contribution, capacity, and purpose
* **Flows** — Trust, surplus, attention, and signal

Surplus refers to the generative capacity of a system that exceeds immediate need. It is the relational and ecological abundance that can be reinvested to develop coherence, care, and capability.

Metabolized through a **7-Field Architecture**:

* **Essence** — What foundational ideal must be propagated
* **Polarity** — What tensions must be held to retain coherence
* **Pattern** — What recurs and replicates
* **Structure** — What scaffolds responsibility and enables distributed agency
* **Bridge** — What holds dynamic transformation without collapse
* **Rhythm** — What shapes environmental context and systemic flows
* **Seed** — What the system can reliably propagate and regenerate

CORE enables systems to hold alignment without flattening life into function or reducing value to price.
