# 0.3 From Meta-Crisis to Regeneration: The Need for Symbolic Grammar

Now **Human-designed systems fail not from a lack of technology but from a lack of coherence. COHERE provides the structure to regenerate coherence at every scale.**

Today, systems expand without shared purpose, act without rhythm, and replicate without trust. They move faster than meaning can stabilize, and they fracture as they grow.

Markets track price but do not register value.\
Financial systems manage scarcity but cannot hold surplus.\
Institutions measure performance but cannot sustain shared direction.

Each of these failures signals a deeper condition:

We are witnessing a breakdown in the structure of meaning.\
An ontological failure.\
\
The root pattern of our meta-crisis

> _“The major problems in the world are the result of the difference between how nature works and how people think.” —_ **Gregory Bateson**

## Why Grammar Matters

Systems cannot function without coherence.\
Institutions cannot govern without shared language.\
Change cannot spread without structural alignment.

Grammar is the architecture of meaning.\
It determines what can be seen, said, and done before action occurs.

What grammar does not express, a culture cannot perceive.\
What it cannot hold, a system cannot steward.\
What it does not encode, a world cannot propagate.

The grammar of today’s systems encodes fragmentation.\
It collapses trust into control.\
It compresses value into price.\
It translates life into metrics.\
\
It cannot express care.\
It cannot hold surplus.\
It cannot maintain coherence.

**COHERE restores grammar as a structural condition for regeneration.**\
It provides the symbolic infrastructure through which human ecosystems can hold meaning, transfer trust, and remain coherent as they grow.\
This grammar defines what must be structurally present for coherence to be possible again.

When grammar holds, coherence becomes possible.\
When coherence holds, regeneration becomes inevitable.
