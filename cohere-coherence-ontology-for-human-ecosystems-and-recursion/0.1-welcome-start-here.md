# 0.1 Welcome / Start Here

Welcome to COHERE\
&#xNAN;_&#x54;he Coherence Ontology for Human Ecosystems and Recursion._\
This site introduces a system architecture designed to align purpose, structure, and flow across projects, organizations, and ecosystems.

COHERE does not function as a theory or framework. It encodes a regenerative design grammar. It clarifies why systems lose coherence, how to restore it, and what structural conditions are required to sustain life-aligned propagation.

Who This Is For\
Strategic leaders seeking structural tools for complex systems\
Regenerative practitioners working in bioregions, cooperatives, or trust-based networks\
Investors and stewards looking for the propagation logic behind scalable, non-extractive design

Where to Start\
Begin with Why Do Our Economies Lack Coherence? for structural problem framing\
Continue to The 7-Field Architecture for ontological foundation\
Read The 7-Fold Recursive Process to access procedural recursion\
Review Versioning Logic to see current propagation stage\
Go to Application & Implementation to understand where system coherence is being enacted

Each section reflects a structural commitment: to design systems that align identity, trust, and propagation.
