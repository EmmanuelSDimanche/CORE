# Recursive Ontogenesis and Epistemic Integration

The development of CORE does not follow a roadmap of incremental updates. It unfolds through recursive ontogenesis. Each phase integrates distinct epistemic grammars that activate structural capacity. \
\
This section tracks the internal architecture of that emergence. It weaves the symbolic logic of versioning, the methodology for epistemic tracking, and the current integration status into a unified developmental layer. \
\
Together, these elements reveal how CORE gains coherence not through accumulation, but through constraint, recursion, and ontological alignment.
