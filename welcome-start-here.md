Welcome to CORE\
&#xNAN;_&#x54;he Coherence Ontology for Regenerative Economies._&#x20;

This site introduces a system architecture designed to align purpose, structure, and flow across projects, organizations, and ecosystems.

CORE is not a theory or a framework. It is a regenerative design grammar. It clarifies why systems lose coherence, how to restore it, and what structural conditions are required to sustain life-aligned value creation.

**Who This Is For**

* Strategic leaders seeking alignment tools for complex systems
* Regenerative practitioners working in bioregions, cooperatives, or trust-based networks
* Investors and stewards looking for the structural logic behind scalable, non-extractive design

**Where to Start**

* Begin with _Why Do Our Economies Lack Coherence?_ for a systemic problem framing
* Continue to _The 7-Field Architecture_ for the structural foundation
* Read _The 7-Fold Recursive Process_ to explore procedural activation
* Review _Versioning Logic_ to see where CORE is in its development
* Go to _Application & Implementation_ to understand how value is created now

Every section reflects a single commitment: to build systems that serve life.
