# CORE -- Coherence Ontology for Regenerative Economies

<mark style="color:orange;">DISCLAIMER: This document is an incomplete working draft.</mark>

> _"Things work better when they work together, on purpose."_ — Tom Graves

**CORE is a symbolic infrastructure designed to help regenerative systems cohere.**\
It provides a grammar that allows structure, flow, and purpose to align across projects, networks, and territories.\
It does not prescribe methods or models. It encodes the deep logic from which life-serving systems can be designed, stewarded, and evolved.

CORE is not a static doctrine. It is a living symbolic architecture, open to refinement through use, propagation, and collective application.

This document is a working draft of that grammar.
