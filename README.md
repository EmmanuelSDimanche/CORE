# COHERE -- Coherence Ontology for Human Ecosystems & Recursion

<mark style="color:orange;">DISCLAIMER: This document is an incomplete working draft.</mark>

> _"Things work better when they work together, on purpose."_ — Tom Graves

**COHERE is symbolic infrastructure for systems that must maintain coherence while evolving. It encodes the structural grammar required for identity, structure, and flow to align across projects, networks, institutions, and ecosystems.**

It does not prescribe methods or models. It encodes the deep logic from which life-serving systems can be designed, stewarded, and evolved.

COHERE is not a static doctrine. It is a living symbolic architecture, open to refinement through use, propagation, and collective application.

This document is a working draft of that grammar.
