# How to Engage With CORE

CORE provides a structural grammar for regenerative systems. The following invitations are open for engagement, contribution, or support.

**1. Alignment Sessions**\
Organizations, networks, and initiatives can request a CORE Alignment Session.\
These sessions surface structural tensions, clarify systemic roles, and realign architecture using the 7-Field Ontology.

→ _Request a session to apply CORE within a project or organization._

**2a. Epistemic Contributions**\
Researchers and systems thinkers can contribute to the Ontology by sharing aligned frameworks, models, or conceptual anchors.\
Valid contributions are reviewed and mapped directly into the structural logic of CORE.

→ _Send a note if you work with geometry, recursion, systemic logic, or regenerative design._

**2b. Tooling Integration**\
Developers and platform architects can explore integration between CORE and existing systems.\
CORE provides the symbolic foundation; tooling can carry that structure into operational form.

→ _If you work on infrastructure tools, protocols, or coordination layers, connect to explore integration._

**3. Funding and Resourcing**\
Funders focused on systems change, regenerative economies, or coherence infrastructure can support version stabilization and implementation design.\
Resourcing CORE helps make coherence operational across contexts.

→ _To discuss aligned funding, send a direct message with interest and scope._
